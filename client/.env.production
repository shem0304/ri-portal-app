# Vite production env (used by `vite build`).
# If you deploy the client as a separate Render Static Site, set this to your API Web Service URL:
# VITE_API_BASE=https://<your-api-service>.onrender.com
#
# If you deploy as a single Render Web Service that serves both UI and API on the same domain,
# leave this empty so the client calls `/api/...` on the same origin.
